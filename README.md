# **0xff CIS110 Projects**

## Description:
This repository hosts a series of code snippets and projects completed through UPenn's F'15 & F'20 CIS110 course.

*The programs are written in Java, the programming language used throughout both courses.*

**Course Website:** [CIS110 2015 Website](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis110/15fa/) | [CIS110 2020 Website](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis110/20fa/)

## Cloud-Based Integrated Development Environment

> **Description:**
>
> This project implements a desgin of one's choice in MIT's block-based and visual programming platform - [scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu). The program I created and developed, `Planets Spiral Orbit`, features two planets that orbit a common star, their sun; which they spiral out of as time passes.
