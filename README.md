> **Description:**
>
> This project implements a desgin of one's choice in MIT's block-based and visual programming platform - [scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu). The program I created and developed, `Planets Spiral Orbit`, features two planets that orbit a common star, their sun; which they spiral out of as time passes.
